    <p>In this lab, we will learn how to build <strong>Action-Based Extensibility</strong> (ABX) actions and subscribe them to deployment lifecycle event topics. &nbsp;We will build two actions that will accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ABX action that will take an SSH key published in GitLab and &nbsp;inject it into the machine resources part of a deployment, therefore &nbsp;allowing us to SSH to all newly deployed VMs.</li>
<li>An ABX action that will post a notification message with information about the deployment in a Slack channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>first action</strong> will show us how we can manipulate deployment payload in an ABX action and return this back to the Event Broker Service so that this can be used as part of the deployment. </p>
<p>The <strong>second action</strong> one shows how we can integrate with a 3rd party system via REST.</p>
<p>This is where it really starts to get <strong>fun</strong>!</p>
