    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Virtual Livefire Solutions</strong> Series. &nbsp;This is the <strong>VMware Cloud Services One Day Series - Cloud Automation&nbsp;</strong>session. &nbsp;This course will consist first of 90-120 minutes of lecture, presentation, and discussion, followed up by hours of extensive lab exercises. &nbsp;Attendees will have access to the Livefire Lab environment for approximately two days following the lecture, giving you time to fully explore the various integrated products and services with their unique functionalities and combined solutions, all at your own pace.</p>
<p>This course focuses primarily on utilizing <strong>VMware vRealize Automation Cloud</strong>, part of the comprehensive catalog of <strong>VMware Cloud</strong> Products and Services providing an integrated customer solution covering deployment, lifecycle, monitoring and security for cloud native apps and legacy applications deployed across multiple clouds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Livefire Solutions</strong> team utilizes VMware Cloud on AWS to provide a Linux based remote desktop via Horizon for accessing the labs, which also happens to serve as our team's "on-prem" vSphere environment. &nbsp;The Livefire Team also maintains a private Slack Workspace, where all students are invited and encouraged to remotely engage with the Livefire Instructors and each other with questions, responses, discussions, and general brainstorming, all within a dedicated classroom channel.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the class and the labs. &nbsp;Shall we begin?</p>
